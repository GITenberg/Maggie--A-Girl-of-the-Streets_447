description: 'Maggie: A Girl of the Streets is an 1893 novel by American author Stephen
  Crane. Often called a novella because of its short length, it was Crane''s first
  published fictional work. Because the work was considered too risqu√© by publishers,
  Crane, who was 21 years-old at the time, had to finance the publication of the novel
  himself. The novel takes place in the Bowery, a New York neighborhood in lower Manhattan.-
  Excerpted from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.'
